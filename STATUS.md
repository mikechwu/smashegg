## Current phase: M2 (generic GameRoom DO) — M1 gate approved 2026-07-14

**Last updated:** 2026-07-14

## M2 (2026-07-14, in progress) — GameRoom DO + session/room plumbing

- **M1 gate approved by owner.** The three audit findings resolved: **all stay guarded** (loud init rejection + tests, already in place) — `tributeLevelBasis='previousLevel'` (hair-split, owner never selects it), `levelTrack='shared'`+`demote` (semantics undefined by any source, combination nobody wants), `equalTributeAssignment='winnersChoose'` (Western variant, wrong lineage). The `aceFinishDemotes`×suspension ambiguity stays logged as-is. Documented in spec §10 "Implementation status" with per-decision reasoning; any can be promoted later behind its existing key.
- **New owner requirements folded into PLAN §4/§5/§9:** (A) seat-token authority model — one connection may hold up to all 4 seat tokens (full self-play); redaction keyed strictly on tokens held (the one correctness property that matters under the deliberately relaxed anti-cheat posture); one multiplexed socket chosen over N sockets. (B) lobby phase — per-room `{gameId, config}` opaque to the room layer, editable pre-start with live broadcast, frozen at `Game.init`; chosen default: any seated player edits, any starts once all seats claimed. Guandan's rule-picker UI and the draw-card ceremony are tracked M3 items.
- Build order: guess-number engine + registry (agent) → protocol + GameRoom DO rewrite (orchestrator, hard tier) → e2e harness / dump→replay generalization / live gates → Codex (resync) + Grok (seat-token redaction) audits.

## M1 (2026-07-14) — pure Guandan engine + replay harness: GATE REPORT

Build shape: foundations (PRNG/cards/config/types) by the orchestrator; five modules (combos+wilds → generate; tribute, levels, trick) by a staged fable/sonnet workflow against frozen foundations; `GameDefinition` glue by the orchestrator; four gate suites by a parallel workflow. **296 tests green, 4 typecheck configs clean (engine purity guard included), engine line coverage 97.94% (gate ≥90%).**

### Exit gate — the three owner-review items

| # | Gate criterion | Evidence | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Property tests for all six PLAN §3 obligations | `tests/unit/engine/obligations.property.test.ts` — 19 tests over the default profile + 14 single-key config variants (~31 seeded playouts); failures emit replayable `{seed, config, actions}` artifacts (verified end-to-end by fault injection) | ✅ pass |
| 2 | Every spec §9 edge case a named test; coverage ≥90%; purity guard | `tests/unit/engine/spec-edge-cases.test.ts` — §9.1…§9.22 map 1:1 to tests named "§9.N …"; coverage 97.94% lines; `tsconfig.engine.json` compiles with zero platform types | ✅ pass |
| 3 | Replay reconstructs a scripted match bit-for-bit | `scripts/replay.ts` (engine-pure core) + `replay-cli.ts`; `tests/unit/replay.test.ts` proves every-seq snapshot equality across ≥3 full hands (default + variant config), tamper detection at the exact seq, harness self-determinism | ✅ pass |

Obligation → test mapping: (1) determinism, (2) serializability, (3) zero-trust views incl. no-PRNG-leak + redaction under every visibility config, (4) legalActions⇔applyAction (canonical-form for plays, exact for choice phases — plus generate.test.ts's brute-force completeness property), (5) liveness incl. defaultAction-applies-ok in every phase, (6) locale-free error/event grammar — all in `obligations.property.test.ts`, cross-covered by `integration.test.ts` (seeded bot playouts to natural matchEnd, bit-identical same-seed replays).

Owner house rules: `tests/unit/engine/house-rules.test.ts` — 14 named engine-driven tests: 1-2/1-3 win at A, 1-4 does not; K+3 clamps to A; the full suspension lifecycle (exhaust → opponents' level with `suspensionApplied` → win clears flag → fresh counter → A window reopens); return-tribute `levelValue ≤ 10` at level T incl. fallback; mixed SJ+BJ never a pair anywhere (validator + 120-combination generator sweep); 接风 both branches.

### Cross-model audit (panel: Codex + Grok primary; Gemini fallback)

Surface split per plan — **Codex** (deep: wilds validator/generator + tribute machine; spot: levels/beats) → [docs/audits/M1-codex.md](docs/audits/M1-codex.md); **Grok** (deep: levels/A-attempt/level-selection + bomb hierarchy + comparison + hand-boundary glue; spot: tribute leader/equal-assign, generate feasibility) → [docs/audits/M1-grok.md](docs/audits/M1-grok.md). Both anchoring-free (spec + code only, no conclusions shared). Mutual spot-check areas: both clean. **Gemini: skipped** — the surface partitioned cleanly into per-subsystem reads within Codex/Grok context windows; no single-pass whole-repo need (per-milestone decision, recorded here).

Findings (all in NON-default config space; zero blockers; default/CORE paths clean in both reports):
1. **`tributeLevelBasis:'previousLevel'` was dead config (silently ignored)** — found INDEPENDENTLY by both lineages (convergence; our own 15-config test matrix missed this key, which is exactly the panel's value). Mitigated: loud `config.notImplemented` at init + test. **Owner decision pending:** implement pre-M3 vs leave guarded.
2. **`levelTrack:'shared'` + `aFailConsequence:'demote'` desyncs the shared ladder** (Grok; per-team demotion breaks the shared invariant and a later shared upgrade drags the other team down). Spec leaves shared-ladder demotion undefined. Mitigated: loud init rejection of the combination + test. **Owner decision pending:** define semantics vs leave guarded.
3. `equalTributeAssignment:'winnersChoose'` unusable — known, deliberate, init-rejected (needs a decision action). **Owner decision pending:** implement pre-M3 vs leave guarded.

Spec ambiguity logged (Grok, not scored a defect): `aceFinishDemotes` × `suspendPlayOpponentLevel` on the same hand — spec silent; engine applies the ace demote after suspension and can wipe the flag; both keys non-default.

### Honest uncertainties (from suite authors, verbatim substance)
- `antiTributeDecision` phase is exercised via documented constructed states (bounded playouts can't guarantee both big jokers land on payers); §9.19's "leftovers never consulted" proven indirectly (fresh-27-card assertion after a real hand transition); §9.4's invariant-holds is probabilistic (4 seeded playouts, no throw, jiefeng exercised).
- Long-horizon A-machinery under `demote`/`none` exercised only as far as ≤8-hand playouts climb (house-rules tests cover the A scenarios via constructed states instead).

### M1 deltas worth noting
- `@cloudflare/workers-types` v5 + `@types/node` + `@vitest/coverage-v8` added; `tsconfig.scripts.json` is the 4th typecheck config (replay CLI split from the engine-pure core so node types never leak into client/engine checks).

## Round 3 (2026-07-13) — owner sign-off + rule-default decisions → M0 started

- **Owner signed off PLAN.md rev 2** subject to rule-default decisions, all now applied (spec v1.3):
  - Confirmed: `aWinPartnerNotLast=true`, `overshootWinsGame=false`, `returnTributeMaxRank=10`, `fullHouseJokerPair=true` (mixed SJ+BJ never a pair — CORE reaffirmed; spec §2.2/§4.1 already enforce it, M1 tests will assert it), `jiefengRecipient=partner` with the exact §5.6 condition (already specified verbatim — no change needed, confirmed).
  - **Changed:** A-attempt failure → `aFailConsequence: suspendPlayOpponentLevel|demote|none`, owner default `suspendPlayOpponentLevel` — never demote; per-team `aAttemptsExhausted` flag; hands play at opponents' level while set (a §1.5 level-selection refinement); flag clears on the team's next hand win, so A resumes automatically. Sub-decision taken per owner intent: attempt counter restarts **fresh** on resumption (`aAttemptCounterReset`, default `fresh`, sub-config kept cheap). Table now 25 keys.
  - Light research on whether "suspend + play opponents' level" is a documented named variant: launched (results logged here when in).
- **Build order confirmed:** M0 → M1 → M2 → M3 → M4 → M5; G-COMPOSE + G-ALARM retired first at hello-world cost. `aFailConsequence` module tracked pre-M3 (M1 engine work).
- **M0 scaffold built and locally verified** (4 scaffold agents + orchestrator verification pass):
  - Green: all 3 typechecks (engine purity guard / server strict + workers-types v5 / client), 5/5 unit tests (i18n key parity, default zh-Hant, interpolation), vite build, and a full `wrangler dev` smoke: `/api/health` JSON; static SPA served with `lang="zh-Hant"`; DO SQLite counter; **alarm armed and fired at +15.003s (G-ALARM local sanity — real gate is the free-tier deploy)**; hibernation-API WebSocket echo (raw-socket handshake + frame test); invalid room codes and unknown `/api/*` paths → JSON 404.
  - Fixes found by verification (all applied): `@cloudflare/workers-types` pin didn't exist on the registry and wrangler 4.110 requires the v5 major (→ `^5.20260708.1`); `GameRoom` wasn't re-exported from the Worker entrypoint (wrangler refuses to boot); demo room code `HELLO2A` was 7 chars against a 6-char route regex (orchestrator's own prompt bug → `TABLE2`); unknown `/api/*` fell through to the SPA fallback and answered API calls with HTML (→ explicit 404 guard).
  - **aFailConsequence research (light) — clean null result:** the exact suspend/never-demote/resume-on-win combination is not documented anywhere as a named variant; closest analogues are 联众's "继续打A不会降级" room toggle and pagat's David Wu demote-to-opponents'-level. Tagged house VARIANT, owner-specified. → docs/research/afail-consequence-research.md; spec §6.4 notes it.
  - **Ops constraint (owner, 2026-07-13): Firecrawl disabled** (credit limit reached) — all research agents now use built-in WebSearch/WebFetch + curl + `gh`; recorded in METHODOLOGY.md's tool ladder.
  - **Live gates PASSED (2026-07-13, free tier):** first deploy succeeded — `https://smashegg.mikechwu-iams.workers.dev`. **G-COMPOSE ✅**: one deploy serves the zh-Hant SPA + Worker API + Durable Object (SQLite counter persisted). **G-ALARM ✅**: DO alarm armed at epoch-ms 1783991776736 and fired at 1783991791736 — exactly +15.000s — on the deployed free plan. API hardening verified live (unknown `/api/*` → JSON 404). Note: a freshly registered workers.dev subdomain returned Cloudflare `error 1042` for the first ~1 minute — plain propagation delay, recovered on retry; logged so nobody debugs it as a code bug later.
  - **GitHub live (2026-07-14):** repo `mikechwu/smashegg` (public, owner-created), both commits pushed. **CI workflow: green** on GitHub runners (typecheck ×3, unit tests, build, dist assertions). `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` secret and `WORKER_URL` variable set via `gh`. **Deploy workflow: red, expected** — fails precisely at wrangler auth because `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` is not yet set (verified in the run log; nothing else is wrong).
  - **M0 CLOSED (2026-07-14).** CI API token `smashegg-ci` created in the dashboard via browser automation (Workers-edit template; Account Resources = the single account; Zone Resources = all zones of that account; a distinct name so the pre-existing similarly-templated token used elsewhere stays untouched). Token verified active against `/user/tokens/verify`, stored only as the `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` GitHub secret, then the Deploy workflow re-ran **green** (run 29298708261: typecheck → tests → build → dist assertions → `wrangler deploy` → post-deploy smoke against WORKER_URL). M0 exit gate fully satisfied: push-to-main auto-deploys the localized hello page; PLAN/STATUS/SETUP in repo; CI green; **G-COMPOSE ✅ G-ALARM ✅** on the deployed free tier.

### Next: M1 — pure Guandan rules engine + deterministic replay harness
Per PLAN §9: combination detection/comparison, the 逢人配 template-matching validator (spec §4.4), legal-move generation, tribute state machine, level/A-attempt logic incl. `aFailConsequence=suspendPlayOpponentLevel`, 25-key RuleVariant config, property tests for the six interface obligations, spec-§9 edge cases as named tests, `scripts/replay.ts`. Cross-model audit (Codex + Gemini) at the gate.

## Round 2 (2026-07-13) — owner feedback incorporated

**Cross-model usage this round** (per PLAN §9 panel policy): web-research fan-out + synthesis by Claude-family agents (2 researchers: research-methodology extraction, Guandan tribute verification); **Codex CLI** ran the anchoring-free consistency review of the revised tribute/anti-tribute spec sections (load-bearing rules change → independent lineage required). **Codex result: 0 rule errors, 13 areas checked-clean (coverage documented), 4 blocking ambiguities found and fixed** — `seatOrder` direction now bound to `turnDirection` (not absolute clockwise); double-tribute payment staging + atomic reveal defined (was only defined for returns); `returnNoLowCardPolicy: anyCard` semantics scoped; `antiTributeMode: optional` state machine specified (decide-before-reveal, unanimity for split jokers, decline reveals nothing, default-action = invoke). Gemini/Grok not run this round — no large-context or third-lineage-corroboration task met the budget bar; both verified installed for milestone gates.

### Done (verified)
- **Rules corrections (owner + official-source verification).** Located the official 《竞技掼蛋竞赛规则（试行）》 tribute clause verbatim (two agreeing copies); full per-question verification: [docs/research/guandan-tribute-verification.md](docs/research/guandan-tribute-verification.md). Spec bumped to v1.2:
  - Tribute/return are **choices over eligible sets** (rank forced, card chosen); `legalActions` exposes the sets for UI hinting; `applyAction` validates membership.
  - Tribute and return cards **public to all four players** (owner-pinned; official + pagat concordant); double-tribute returns revealed simultaneously → engine applies both `tributeReturned` events atomically.
  - Anti-tribute: condition verified verbatim; **mandatory public reveal** of the qualifying big jokers with holder attribution, nothing else; `antiTributeMode: auto|optional` (default `auto`).
  - `equalTributeAssignment: seatOrder|random|winnersChoose` replaces `doubleTributeTieAward` (three-way source conflict: official/唐人游/pagat); `doubleTributeTieLead` **removed** (lead rule unanimous & derivable); `returnNoLowCardPolicy` fallback now CORE-backed by official text. Table now 23 keys, each tagged house-rules-sensitive (✓) or technical (—).
- **PLAN.md rev 2:** new §6 Debuggability (deterministic replay harness, gated room-dump affordance, structured per-mutation logs — required deliverables in the M1/M2 gates); per-seat `hints` in the wire protocol; obligations delta stated (ob. 4 split combination/choice scope, ob. 3 gains reveal-scope assertions); named gate checks **G-COMPOSE / G-ALARM / G-WSMETER** promoted from the risk register into M0/M2 exit gates; audit panel = Codex + Gemini + optional Grok (all three CLIs verified installed).
- **Research methodology adopted from an internal reference research project** → [docs/research/METHODOLOGY.md](docs/research/METHODOLOGY.md) (full extraction with file-level provenance kept in local notes, not pushed). Adopted: research-over-memory with fetch dates; ≥2-source corroboration with low-trust-source discarding; per-claim VERIFIED/UNCERTAIN tags; null results headlined with diagnosis; question-first research prompts; anchoring-free cross-checks; "checked, no finding" coverage lists; named pre-declared gates; dated supersession markers; self-correction logging. Not adopted (domain-specific): backtesting conventions, walk-forward/purged CV, DSR/PBO, market-data hygiene, conformal gating, trading metrics, cost modeling.

### Null results / dead ends (this round)
- **No decline flow for 抗贡 exists anywhere.** Targeted searches (放弃抗贡 / 可以不抗贡 / 选择进贡) found nothing across official rules, platforms, and explainers; the option is also strategically dominated. Diagnosis: genuinely unspecified because unwanted — `antiTributeMode:'optional'` is retained as future-proofing only.
- **The official clause text does not spell out the anti-tribute reveal step** — platform practice and physical necessity make it standard; tagged UNCERTAIN (narrow sense) in spec §7.6 while the reveal remains required behavior here.
- **Equal-tribute assignment is a genuine three-way source conflict** (official seat-order / 唐人游 random / pagat winners-choose) — documented as such and made a config key rather than resolved.
- (Carried from round 1) No Cloudflare-endorsed "event log + seq resync" recipe; no documented per-DO WS-connection or session-duration caps beyond the 32,768 ceiling.

### Corrections log
- Round-1 self-corrections (from the 3-reviewer adversarial pass, 24 findings — 2 blockers among them: no randomness path for mid-match deals; tribute computed from leftover cards in three spec locations): all fixed; details in the 2026-07-13 round-1 entry below.
- Round-2: `doubleTributeTieAward/-TieLead` design superseded by verified sources (see above) — logged here rather than silently rewritten.

### Assumed (explicitly, not verified)
- Wrangler v4 still the current major (docs confirm v4 line active; npm blocked) — re-verified at M0.
- DO request accounting for inbound WS messages — named gate **G-WSMETER** (M2).
- DO Alarms free-plan availability (inferred from pricing structure) — named gate **G-ALARM** (M0, re-checked hibernated M2).
- Assets+DO-in-one-Worker composition (two documented config blocks, no single worked example) — named gate **G-COMPOSE** (M0).

### Next
1. **[BLOCKED on user]** Sign-off on PLAN.md rev 2 (checklist in PLAN §11). Owner said they'll personally review the RuleVariant table: docs/rules/guandan.md §10 — 23 keys, house-rules-sensitive ones tagged ✓.
2. Then M0 (needs SETUP.md human steps 2.1–2.5).

## Round 1 (2026-07-13) — initial research & plan

- Research fan-out (4 parallel agents): Cloudflare facts, reconnection patterns, reference-implementation audit (local notes), Guandan spec — findings in docs/research/ + docs/rules/ with per-item VERIFIED/UNCERTAIN tags.
- PLAN.md v1 drafted; then a 3-reviewer adversarial pass (interface adequacy / rules consistency / infra-fact consistency) returned 24 findings, all triaged and fixed — including 2 blockers: (a) the interface had no randomness path for dealing hand N+1 of an unbounded match (fixed: serializable PRNG state inside S + no-actorless-phases rule); (b) the rules spec computed tribute from the previous hand's leftover cards (fixed: newly dealt hand). Majors: advisory `expectedSeq` (double-tribute concurrency), `viewEvent(config)`, canonical-form obligation 4, generation-range/joker-guard/joker-bomb fixes, §3.8 wild policy, demotion timing, fabricated "20:1" figure removed, alarms uncertainty surfaced, token-template name de-asserted.
