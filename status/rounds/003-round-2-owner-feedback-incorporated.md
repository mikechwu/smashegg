## Round 2 (2026-07-13) — owner feedback incorporated

**Cross-model usage this round** (per PLAN §9 panel policy): web-research fan-out + synthesis by Claude-family agents (2 researchers: research-methodology extraction, Guandan tribute verification); **Codex CLI** ran the anchoring-free consistency review of the revised tribute/anti-tribute spec sections (load-bearing rules change → independent lineage required). **Codex result: 0 rule errors, 13 areas checked-clean (coverage documented), 4 blocking ambiguities found and fixed** — `seatOrder` direction now bound to `turnDirection` (not absolute clockwise); double-tribute payment staging + atomic reveal defined (was only defined for returns); `returnNoLowCardPolicy: anyCard` semantics scoped; `antiTributeMode: optional` state machine specified (decide-before-reveal, unanimity for split jokers, decline reveals nothing, default-action = invoke). Gemini/Grok not run this round — no large-context or third-lineage-corroboration task met the budget bar; both verified installed for milestone gates.

### Done (verified)
- **Rules corrections (owner + official-source verification).** Located the official the official Competitive Guandan Rules (Trial) tribute clause verbatim (two agreeing copies); full per-question verification: [docs/research/guandan-tribute-verification.md](docs/research/guandan-tribute-verification.md). Spec bumped to v1.2:
  - Tribute/return are **choices over eligible sets** (rank forced, card chosen); `legalActions` exposes the sets for UI hinting; `applyAction` validates membership.
  - Tribute and return cards **public to all four players** (owner-pinned; official + pagat concordant); double-tribute returns revealed simultaneously → engine applies both `tributeReturned` events atomically.
  - Anti-tribute: condition verified verbatim; **mandatory public reveal** of the qualifying big jokers with holder attribution, nothing else; `antiTributeMode: auto|optional` (default `auto`).
  - `equalTributeAssignment: seatOrder|random|winnersChoose` replaces `doubleTributeTieAward` (three-way source conflict: official/Tangrenyou/pagat); `doubleTributeTieLead` **removed** (lead rule unanimous & derivable); `returnNoLowCardPolicy` fallback now CORE-backed by official text. Table now 23 keys, each tagged house-rules-sensitive (✓) or technical (—).
- **PLAN.md rev 2:** new §6 Debuggability (deterministic replay harness, gated room-dump affordance, structured per-mutation logs — required deliverables in the M1/M2 gates); per-seat `hints` in the wire protocol; obligations delta stated (ob. 4 split combination/choice scope, ob. 3 gains reveal-scope assertions); named gate checks **G-COMPOSE / G-ALARM / G-WSMETER** promoted from the risk register into M0/M2 exit gates; audit panel = Codex + Gemini + optional Grok (all three CLIs verified installed).
- **Research methodology adopted from an internal reference research project** → [docs/research/METHODOLOGY.md](docs/research/METHODOLOGY.md) (full extraction with file-level provenance kept in local notes, not pushed). Adopted: research-over-memory with fetch dates; ≥2-source corroboration with low-trust-source discarding; per-claim VERIFIED/UNCERTAIN tags; null results headlined with diagnosis; question-first research prompts; anchoring-free cross-checks; "checked, no finding" coverage lists; named pre-declared gates; dated supersession markers; self-correction logging. Not adopted (domain-specific): backtesting conventions, walk-forward/purged CV, DSR/PBO, market-data hygiene, conformal gating, trading metrics, cost modeling.

### Null results / dead ends (this round)
- **No decline flow for anti-tribute exists anywhere.** Targeted searches (decline anti-tribute / can decline anti-tribute / choose tribute) found nothing across official rules, platforms, and explainers; the option is also strategically dominated. Diagnosis: genuinely unspecified because unwanted — `antiTributeMode:'optional'` is retained as future-proofing only.
- **The official clause text does not spell out the anti-tribute reveal step** — platform practice and physical necessity make it standard; tagged UNCERTAIN (narrow sense) in spec §7.6 while the reveal remains required behavior here.
- **Equal-tribute assignment is a genuine three-way source conflict** (official seat-order / Tangrenyou random / pagat winners-choose) — documented as such and made a config key rather than resolved.
- (Carried from round 1) No Cloudflare-endorsed "event log + seq resync" recipe; no documented per-DO WS-connection or session-duration caps beyond the 32,768 ceiling.

### Corrections log
- Round-1 self-corrections (from the 3-reviewer adversarial pass, 24 findings — 2 blockers among them: no randomness path for mid-match deals; tribute computed from leftover cards in three spec locations): all fixed; details in the 2026-07-13 round-1 entry below.
- Round-2: `doubleTributeTieAward/-TieLead` design superseded by verified sources (see above) — logged here rather than silently rewritten.

### Assumed (explicitly, not verified)
- Wrangler v4 still the current major (docs confirm v4 line active; npm blocked) — re-verified at M0.
- DO request accounting for inbound WS messages — named gate **G-WSMETER** (M2).
- DO Alarms free-plan availability (inferred from pricing structure) — named gate **G-ALARM** (M0, re-checked hibernated M2).
- Assets+DO-in-one-Worker composition (two documented config blocks, no single worked example) — named gate **G-COMPOSE** (M0).

### Next
1. **[BLOCKED on user]** Sign-off on PLAN.md rev 2 (checklist in PLAN §11). Owner said they'll personally review the RuleVariant table: docs/rules/guandan.md §10 — 23 keys, house-rules-sensitive ones tagged ✓.
2. Then M0 (needs SETUP.md human steps 2.1–2.5).
