## M1 (2026-07-14) — pure Guandan engine + replay harness: GATE REPORT

Build shape: foundations (PRNG/cards/config/types) by the orchestrator; five modules (combos+wilds → generate; tribute, levels, trick) by a staged fable/sonnet workflow against frozen foundations; `GameDefinition` glue by the orchestrator; four gate suites by a parallel workflow. **296 tests green, 4 typecheck configs clean (engine purity guard included), engine line coverage 97.94% (gate ≥90%).**

### Exit gate — the three owner-review items

| # | Gate criterion | Evidence | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Property tests for all six PLAN §3 obligations | `tests/unit/engine/obligations.property.test.ts` — 19 tests over the default profile + 14 single-key config variants (~31 seeded playouts); failures emit replayable `{seed, config, actions}` artifacts (verified end-to-end by fault injection) | ✅ pass |
| 2 | Every spec §9 edge case a named test; coverage ≥90%; purity guard | `tests/unit/engine/spec-edge-cases.test.ts` — §9.1…§9.22 map 1:1 to tests named "§9.N …"; coverage 97.94% lines; `tsconfig.engine.json` compiles with zero platform types | ✅ pass |
| 3 | Replay reconstructs a scripted match bit-for-bit | `scripts/replay.ts` (engine-pure core) + `replay-cli.ts`; `tests/unit/replay.test.ts` proves every-seq snapshot equality across ≥3 full hands (default + variant config), tamper detection at the exact seq, harness self-determinism | ✅ pass |

Obligation → test mapping: (1) determinism, (2) serializability, (3) zero-trust views incl. no-PRNG-leak + redaction under every visibility config, (4) legalActions⇔applyAction (canonical-form for plays, exact for choice phases — plus generate.test.ts's brute-force completeness property), (5) liveness incl. defaultAction-applies-ok in every phase, (6) locale-free error/event grammar — all in `obligations.property.test.ts`, cross-covered by `integration.test.ts` (seeded bot playouts to natural matchEnd, bit-identical same-seed replays).

Owner house rules: `tests/unit/engine/house-rules.test.ts` — 14 named engine-driven tests: 1-2/1-3 win at A, 1-4 does not; K+3 clamps to A; the full suspension lifecycle (exhaust → opponents' level with `suspensionApplied` → win clears flag → fresh counter → A window reopens); return-tribute `levelValue ≤ 10` at level T incl. fallback; mixed SJ+BJ never a pair anywhere (validator + 120-combination generator sweep); jiefeng both branches.

### Cross-model audit (panel: Codex + Grok primary; Gemini fallback)

Surface split per plan — **Codex** (deep: wilds validator/generator + tribute machine; spot: levels/beats) → [docs/audits/M1-codex.md](docs/audits/M1-codex.md); **Grok** (deep: levels/A-attempt/level-selection + bomb hierarchy + comparison + hand-boundary glue; spot: tribute leader/equal-assign, generate feasibility) → [docs/audits/M1-grok.md](docs/audits/M1-grok.md). Both anchoring-free (spec + code only, no conclusions shared). Mutual spot-check areas: both clean. **Gemini: skipped** — the surface partitioned cleanly into per-subsystem reads within Codex/Grok context windows; no single-pass whole-repo need (per-milestone decision, recorded here).

Findings (all in NON-default config space; zero blockers; default/CORE paths clean in both reports):
1. **`tributeLevelBasis:'previousLevel'` was dead config (silently ignored)** — found INDEPENDENTLY by both lineages (convergence; our own 15-config test matrix missed this key, which is exactly the panel's value). Mitigated: loud `config.notImplemented` at init + test. **Owner decision pending:** implement pre-M3 vs leave guarded.
2. **`levelTrack:'shared'` + `aFailConsequence:'demote'` desyncs the shared ladder** (Grok; per-team demotion breaks the shared invariant and a later shared upgrade drags the other team down). Spec leaves shared-ladder demotion undefined. Mitigated: loud init rejection of the combination + test. **Owner decision pending:** define semantics vs leave guarded.
3. `equalTributeAssignment:'winnersChoose'` unusable — known, deliberate, init-rejected (needs a decision action). **Owner decision pending:** implement pre-M3 vs leave guarded.

Spec ambiguity logged (Grok, not scored a defect): `aceFinishDemotes` × `suspendPlayOpponentLevel` on the same hand — spec silent; engine applies the ace demote after suspension and can wipe the flag; both keys non-default.

### Honest uncertainties (from suite authors, verbatim substance)
- `antiTributeDecision` phase is exercised via documented constructed states (bounded playouts can't guarantee both big jokers land on payers); §9.19's "leftovers never consulted" proven indirectly (fresh-27-card assertion after a real hand transition); §9.4's invariant-holds is probabilistic (4 seeded playouts, no throw, jiefeng exercised).
- Long-horizon A-machinery under `demote`/`none` exercised only as far as ≤8-hand playouts climb (house-rules tests cover the A scenarios via constructed states instead).

### M1 deltas worth noting
- `@cloudflare/workers-types` v5 + `@types/node` + `@vitest/coverage-v8` added; `tsconfig.scripts.json` is the 4th typecheck config (replay CLI split from the engine-pure core so node types never leak into client/engine checks).
